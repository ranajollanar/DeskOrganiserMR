# DeskOrganiser MR

## Overview
**DeskOrganiser MR** is a mixed reality (MR) productivity tool designed to enhance workspace organization and efficiency. It enables users to seamlessly integrate virtual tools into their physical environment, creating a hybrid workspace. Users can spawn sticky notes, write notes, set timers, use a stopwatch, take screenshots, play ambient background music, or sketch on a virtual whiteboard. All objects retain their spatial data, ensuring an intuitive and immersive experience.
